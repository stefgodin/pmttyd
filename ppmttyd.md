# Paper Mario the Thousand Year Door (remake) - tboi.com clone
## Base need
Using the wiki is tedious for things such as badges locations, numbers, information, items, recipes and star piece locations.
This project would address these issues by copying the way tboi.com (platinumgod.co.uk) works for the binding of isaac.

While TBOI is a roguelike and thus makes the quick search of badges and items very useful for every run.
There is also some usefullness to it for collectibles in other game genres.

## Things I want in there
### Yesses
  - [ ] Badges
  - [ ] Recipes
    - [ ] Items locations and prices
  - [ ] Star pieces
  - [ ] Shine sprites
### Okays
  - [ ] Enemies
  - [ ] Mecanics (guard, superguard, attack frames, etc.)
### Mehs
  - [ ] Partners
  - [ ] Crystal Stars
  - [ ] Chapters
  - [ ] Characters
  - [ ] Locations

## TODO
  - [ ] Badge list
    - [x] Scrape the paper mario wiki of all badge images and information
    - [x] Group all pictures into a single PNG (sprite sheet) for super fast loading
    - [x] Display it in a cute list
    - [ ] When I click on a badge, a dialog opens with the badge details
    - [ ] A search bar allows me to search anything
  - [ ] Recipe list

## Tech stack
- Vanilla JS?
- HTML
- CSS
- No backend? (why would I need one?)
